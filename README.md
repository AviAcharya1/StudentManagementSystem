# StudentManagementSystem
## Customization

- To change the login credentials, modify the `login` function in `script.js`.
- To add or remove fields in the student registration form, update the `showRegisterForm` function and adjust the `student` object structure accordingly.
- To change the background images, modify the `setBackgroundImage` function calls with different keywords.

## Security Considerations

This project is a demonstration and has several security limitations:

- It uses client-side storage (LocalStorage) which is not secure for sensitive data.
- The login system is a simple check and not suitable for production environments.
- There's no server-side validation or sanitization of input data.

For a production environment, implement proper server-side authentication, use a secure database, and add input validation and sanitization.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement server-side storage and authentication
- Add search and filter functionality for the student list
- Include more detailed student profiles (e.g., courses, grades, attendance)
- Implement different user roles (e.g., admin, teacher, student)
- Add data export functionality (e.g., CSV, PDF reports)

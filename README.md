## Introduction

The Student Management System is a web-based application designed to help educational institutions manage student data efficiently. This system provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to perform various tasks related to student management, including registration, viewing student lists, and updating student information.

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure login system for administrators
- Student Registration: Add new students to the system
- Student List: View all registered students in a tabular format
- Edit Student Information: Update existing student details
- Delete Students: Remove students from the system
- Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- Animated UI: Smooth transitions and interactive elements
- Dynamic Backgrounds: Contextual background images for different sections

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Bootstrap 5: For responsive design and pre-styled components
- Animate.css: For animations
- LocalStorage: For client-side data persistence
- Unsplash API: For dynamic background images

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file:
   - git clone https://github.com/AviAcharya1/StudentManagementSystem.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   - cd StudentManagementSystem
3. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

No additional installation steps are required as this is a client-side application.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Log in using the default credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: password
3. Use the navigation menu to access different features:
- Home: View the welcome page
- Register Student: Add a new student to the system
- Student List: View, edit, or delete existing students
- Logout: End the current session

└── README.md           # Project documentation

## Customization

- To change the login credentials, modify the `login` function in `script.js`.
- To add or remove fields in the student registration form, update the `showRegisterForm` function and adjust the `student` object structure accordingly.
- To change the background images, modify the `setBackgroundImage` function calls with different keywords.

## Security Considerations

This project is a demonstration and has several security limitations:

- It uses client-side storage (LocalStorage) which is not secure for sensitive data.
- The login system is a simple check and not suitable for production environments.
- There's no server-side validation or sanitization of input data.

For a production environment, implement proper server-side authentication, use a secure database, and add input validation and sanitization.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement server-side storage and authentication
- Add search and filter functionality for the student list
- Include more detailed student profiles (e.g., courses, grades, attendance)
- Implement different user roles (e.g., admin, teacher, student)
- Add data export functionality (e.g., CSV, PDF reports)
